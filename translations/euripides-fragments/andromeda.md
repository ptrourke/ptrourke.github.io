## Fragments from a Lost Tragedy of Euripides
### Translated by Patrick Rourke

## Dramatis Personae

* Andromeda
* Echo
* Chorus of Phoenician girls
* Perseus
* Kepheus
* Kassiopeia (?)

[It is sunrise on a strand of beach along Phoenicia's shore. On a rock outcropping, a beautiful 
young girl is chained. She is Andromeda, daughter of Kepheus and Kassiopeia. As the sky 
brightens Andromeda raises her head and sings a lament to the departing Night.]

### Andromeda

Sacred Night,  
in your chariot  
hunting your way  
along the starry limb  
of high Olympus'  
holy element, &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; [_Echo_: -- Lament!]

Why must I, Andromeda,  
find my share of evils  
before all others,  
and come here   
to this precipice  
of death? &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; [_Echo_: -- of death!]

.  .  .

[A Chorus of young women of Phoenicia enters, picking their way along the rocks.]

### Chorus

Now take care,  
step here, step there,   
the lookouts out in front . . . &emsp; &emsp; [_Echo_: -- Hunt!]

.  .  .

### Andromeda

Dear girls, dear friends . . .    

.  .  .

[As Andromeda sings, the echo continues. Andromeda explains to her friends that she has been 
exposed here by her father as a sacrifice to Ketos, the whale. The chorus commisserate. Then 
Andromeda points out the echo, which she doesn't understand, calling it a voice mocking her in 
her tears. The chorus explains that it is Echo, and tells her Echo's story: that she once loved a 
man called Narcissus, who did not requite her love, and never answered her when she spoke; 
she pined away, finally leaping from the rocks near her home to her death; but the gods rescued 
her voice, so that never again would anyone who called out among the rocks be answered only 
by silence.]


### Chorus

Echo, answering your words  
not with words of her own . . . &emsp; &emsp; [_Echo_: -- Alone!]

.  .  .

### Andromeda

I call you, Echo,  
hiding in your caves:  
Leave off, permit me  
to take my fill  
of lamentation  
with these, my dear friends. &emsp; &emsp; [_Echo_: -- Ends!]

.  .  .

[The echo ceases, and the chorus again take up their commiserations.]

### Chorus

A merciless man,  
your father,  
to abandon you out here  
on this strand,  
where Hades will find you  
exposed,  
and the whale will  
devour you! 

A patriotic sacrifice!  

.  .  .

[Andromeda responds.]

### Andromeda

See me now:  

All the promises  
of my childhood  
must remain unfulfilled --  
there will be no bridal songs,  
no dances on my wedding day.  

In their stead,  
I stand here alone  
locked in braided chains,  
exposed, awaiting the arrival  
not of a husband as his bride,  
but of a whale, as its nourishment.  

Sing to me now, my friends,  
not wedding songs,  
no, but dirges.  

Friends, I am suffering;  
sing of my sufferings.  
Let them all know,  
all of my kinsfolk  
and my family,  
tell them my anguish.  

But now, against  
all these disasters  
I entreat the light above  
to shield me from the darkness  
of Hades, the land of many tears.

I am accursed,  
persecuted by a god.  
No one will see my death,  
no one will pluck me away  
before death's arrival.  

If only one of the stars above  
would rain down fire  
and consume me, saving me  
from the horror that awaits.  

But I do not want to see  
the fires of immortality,  
at the price of my body  
hung here, slaughtered,  
for some god's pleasure,  
and my soul, embarking  
on the swift journey  
down to death's darker regions.  

.  .  .

[Perseus wanders in on winged feet. He is immediately struck by Andromeda's beauty of form 
and voice, and her solitary vigil.]

### Perseus

Wait. Who is this girl?  
How beautifully she carries herself.  

What are these waters?  
Who is this siren?  

.  .  .

## Notes

"Sacred Night": The sequence of this opening lyric has been reconstructed on the model of the parodos to Euripides' _Orestes_; it is parodied (almost complete) in Aristophanes̓  _Women at the Festival of Torch Bearers_ (_Thesmophoriazusai_, the Thesmophoria being an important religious 
festival for women in Ancient Athens). Translating the first words of this lyric required avoidance of the translators worst possible pitfall: the line, O hiera nyx, is literally "O Holy Night." I defy any English-speaking reader to hear these words and not complete them with "The stars are brightly shining . . ." Fortunately, the lyric was imitated in Ennius̓  version of Andromeda, and one of the few surviving fragments offers _Sacra nox_. Hence the translation, "Sacred Night."
