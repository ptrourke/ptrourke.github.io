     Then she sat, curling her tail
     <br/>
     under her lion\'s feet,
     <br/>
     folding the great oars of her wings
     <br/>
     down against her back, flowing
     <br/>
     with the ringlets of her mane.
    </p>
    <p>
     . . . her claws . . .
    </p>
    <p>
     . . . when someone stepped
     <br/>
     forward to challenge her,
     <br/>
     she shook her plumage,
     <br/>
     and struck her wings
     <br/>
     against the sun\'s rays.
     <br/>
     When the beast turned
     <br/>
     toward the horses of the sun,
     <br/>
     her wings shined golden-faced;
     <br/>
     but grey-faced when she turned
     <br/>
     towards the clouds,
     <br/>
     reflecting back
     <br/>
     as a Rainbow might. . . .

     . . . there, hissing,
     <br/>
     the blood-stained maiden
     <br/>
     chanted her riddle
     <br/>
     in seven verses, like this:
    </p>
    <p>
     There is something with one voice, with sense,
     <br/>
     uniting in itself three different forms:
     <br/>
     the first one with four-feet,
     <br/>
     then another with two,
     <br/>
     and a three-footed form at last, . . .

     There is only one kind of desire,
     <br/>
     but there are many varieties of pleasure.
     <br/>
     Some desire ugliness, and others beauty;
     <br/>
     some desire evil, and others good.

     NOTES
    </h3>
    <p>
     "Laios, king of Thebes, defied the oracle": Quoted in a handbook on Euripides (P. Oxy. 2455),
which included titles, first lines, and summaries (hypotheses, in Greek) on all of his plays;
about one third of the handbook survives (but very little survives intact).
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then she sat, curling her tail": Fragment 540 Nauck2 , greatly augmented by P. Oxy. 2459.
This sounds like a retrospective description of Oedipus̓  confrontation with the Sphinx,
either by Iokaste or some minor figure explaining how Oedipus, putatively a Korinthian, came
to rule in Thebes. Despite the stunning visual quality of the passage (which is obvious even
through the mutilated papyrus-text), this is spoken verse, not lyric.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We pushed him, Polybos' son, to the ground" Fragment 541 Nauck2, one of
the most controversial fragments in the Euripidean corpus. This fragment boldly
states that Oedipus was blinded by others, not by himself as in Sophokles̓
Oedipus the King; what is more, the fact that Oedipus is identified as Polybos̓ son,
not Laios̓, implies that Oedipus was blinded before he was recognized as the child
of Laios and Iokaste, that is, before his incest was discovered. (T. B. L.
Webster, among others, discusses all the implications of this fragment in
     <em>
      Tragedies of
Euripides
     </em>
     ; I have based my "framework" for the fragments on his discussion.)
