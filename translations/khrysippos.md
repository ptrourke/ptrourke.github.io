# Khrysippos

## Fragments from a Lost Tragedy of Euripides

## Cosmogonic Hymn
(probably the _parodos_)

### Chorus

_Hail holy Earth and divine Sky!_

He is the father  
of men and gods;  
She gathers into herself  
the rain that falls,  
gives birth to all  
that is mortal:  
the grass and the whole   
tribe of beasts;  
truly mother of all things.  

Nothing that comes into being dies,  
but parted one from the other  
changes to another shape.  
What is born of Earth  
returns to Earth,  
What is begotten  
of ethereal seed  
Returns to the vaults  
of heaven.
